# Fivetran SDK for Go Examples

This directory contains examples of how to use `go-fivetran`.

Make sure you read the Fivetran REST API [documentation](https://fivetran.com/docs/rest-api) before using the SDK.

The examples in this directory focus on demonstrating how to use the SDK. All the values are fictional. Be aware that running examples without understanding the Fivetran REST API documentation may lead to an unexpected add/change/delete of your Fivetran account resources. Do not run examples without changing the values according to your needs.

There is a `<serviceName>/main.go` file for each provided service. Services with multiple examples are organized in directories `<serviceName>-<example #>`.
